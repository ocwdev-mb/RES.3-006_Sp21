MICRO is the [*Materials Initiative for Comprehensive Research Opportunity*](https://micro.mit.edu/) created to provide a remote research and education experience to undergraduate students who are members of groups historically underrepresented in science and technology. The program offers participants the ability to conduct cutting-edge materials research with MIT faculty while simultaneously learning the fundamentals of materials science.

The MICRO initiative was developed by graduate students and teaching staff in the [MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE)](https://dmse.mit.edu/) and was initially supported by MIT Open Learningâ€™s [J-WEL Grants in Higher Education](https://jwel.mit.edu/j-wel-grants-higher-education-innovation-2021).
